Once upon a time I published a phone app.

# About
This phone app took about 3 months. I'm not counting the first 2 months of procrastination and an very poor attempt to write it in C++. It is definitely true that some tasks are more difficult if you're using the wrong tools. Many sleepless nights were had. Looking back, I wish I had known about computer networks then. I may have re-invented the wheel many, many times with this.

The motivation behind this app was to solve a recurring problem within my friends. A friend, Ben, would consistently black out nearly every time we hit the bars. Then he'd go on autopilot and we'd typically have a very entertaining story days after when we piece together Ben's brief moments of clarity.

Originally, the plan was to have phones join a lobby hosted by a server. I shrunk it down to a local thing just playing with Bluetooth. 

# Misc.
I've since learned from the internets that a group of CS students at my alma mater, The University of Illinois at Urban-Champaign,have indepentely made a supremely kick-ass app that accomplishes all of my original goals and so much more for their senior design project.
